19M - will it actually go away?
Hello, guys. I woke up this morning with hazy vision and halos with rainbows, eyes were extremely dry and I thought I may have a different issue. I got into an eye doctor today, and they did a complete go-over with my eyes. I found out that I had extreme eyestrain and farsightedness. She said my tears were fine, and there were no scarring or otherwise other bad symptoms. I asked if I had dry eye and she said it was situational and mild, and would ease up with continued use of eye-drops, and when my strain is less. I don't doubt her, but at the same time I've read so much that dry eye is permanent and it only feela like it's gotten worse, though during the day I'm not noticing it much at all. Just in the mornings and going to bed. Is this truly fixable with endured drops or am I going to actually have to do this forever?

38M - my eyes hurt when i wear my glasses... why could it be?
hi! :-)

i've been wearing glasses for a good 15 years, without issues.

until two years ago, when i did a new eye check (my vision only slightly changed, that's good), and i then ordered new glasses online with the prescription i got from the optometrist.

i ordered 3 different pairs, and when i wore these glasses, they immediately felt a bit off - some more than others. it feels like my eyes need to make some kind of effort to adjust... i see sharp with them, that's ok, but yeah, there's a strange sensation that my eyes need to make an effort, it's uncomfortable, and then after a while it becomes very tiring, to the point of giving me headaches. when that's the case, it will pass the day after when i wake up, but then... i need to wear my glasses to work, so...

i feel like some days are better, and that when my sinuses are a bit clogged it's really worse.

so i asked for a second eye test at the same place recently, got the lenses of one pair replaced, but still have the same issue. they checked the pupillary distance and made sure that the lenses match the prescription and it's (at least they say) correct.

anyone has any ideas what could it be?  
i'm wondering if i should make a test somewhere else? like, is it possible that their results were wrong?  
glasses are all so expensive and i would like to avoid to spend more money if that doesn't solve my problem... also, i really like the frames i got online and really want to be able to wear them... but comfortably!

thanks a lot in advance for any help!! :-)

24F Adult lazy eye?

I’ve read that you cannot develop a lazy eye as an adult but something is happening to my left eye. My prescription was fine when I was a kid, but as I’ve gotten older it’s become worse. I used to only have an astigmatism in my left eye, but a year ago I was told my astigmatism in my left eye had drastically become worse and I now had one in my right eye too (maybe I always had an astigmatism in both eyes, but only my left was bad enough to comment on). I switched to astigmatism specific contacts, and I see perfect with them. Better than I’ve ever seen before. But I’ve noticed over the past 4 years my left eye isn’t as coordinated as it used to be / as my right eye. My left eye is now *always* significantly squinted in pictures and kind of off center from the camera lens, sometimes it literally cannot tracking things. 

I don’t knew what to do but it’s affected my confidence and I no longer like taking normal photos. Should I get a the patch to put over my right eye to try to strengthen my left eye?   What is happening to my eye…?

I was trying to take photos to show off a new eyelash map I made that I liked, and it became evident how little my left eye tracks anymore. it scared me. I had to focus extremely hard and take photos from the side to make my eyes look the same for the pictures. *yes I am trying to look at the camera like normal in the photos, I’m not intensionally making one eye drift if that’s even possibly. I am actively trying to take normal pics to show off my lashes*

30F A spark from a match went into my eye
Im having a series of unfortunate events recently. I have a patch of blood in my eye for 2 days, it is not overly painful but itches and feels like something is on the eye

Tonight I was lighting a match and when I struck it, it sparked and flew into the same eye. It is very painful, feels like it is burning and I can’t stop rubbing it. I washed it with cold water and used eye drops. my eye

I can’t tell if my vision is getting worse or not because it’s quite bad in that eye anyways. It’s maybe a little worse but that would be expected since I rubbed it a lot 

What’s the best course of action? (Obviously see an eye doctor but it’s 21:30h and I have would in the morning). I’m wondering if washing it and using drops is the most immediate thing to do?

25M Random cloudiness of vision in both eyes?
Hi all, not sure if this is the right place to ask this but I’ve been seeing what I can find online and haven’t found previously asked questions that quite fit this situation. My fiancé woke up this morning as normal, put in his contacts as he does every day, and drove over an hour to go golf 18 holes. Apparently at some point, his vision became blurry, but not in a super sudden way that he noticed at the exact moment. He says he went inside at some point and that’s when he realized okay yep, it’s really cloudy in here. He thought it was weird but assumed it was his contacts. He was able to drive home (I didn’t know this was happening at the time) and took out his contacts, assuming it would solve the problem but it didn’t. He used some eye drops and left his contacts out for a bit but no luck. He ended up putting contacts back in for the rest of the day. He needs to see a doctor tomorrow, I know, but wanted to see if anyone had insight. His eyes are now really bothering him and hurting when he blinks. They’re both very bloodshot. He says now his left eye is much worse/more cloudy. I looked at them with a light and I genuinely think the fluid around his iris/pupils looks cloudy in his left eye. It’s very slight but I can notice it. We live in San Francisco and he says it looks like the fog just rolled in everywhere- if that helps describe to anyone. 

Online it’s pretty much only saying slow onset things like cataracts or trauma associated cataracts except he’s had no recent trauma and his eyes look cloudy but not in a cataract-like way (I’m a nurse and worked in cataract surgery for a while so I’ve seen enough to know what they look like but no experience in other eye things so I can’t speculate). Any ideas?? We don’t have an eye doctor here (just moved) but will do what we can to get him in tomorrow.

33M - Dark shadow in my peripheral vision when I blink
I am 33M, live in Sweden, and currently take no medicine. Previously, l took sertraline/zoloft, but stopped in late 2023 due to side-effects (including a pounding heart that caused chest pain.)

Mild myopia (-1.25) in the affected eye.

In early spring 2024, I noticed a dark shadow, almost circular, in the top-right vision of my right eye. It only appears when I blink and quickly fades away. Most visible on bright, clear surfaces, but not only that. I am uncertain if the shadow has changed in size since I first noticed it.

This summer, I met an ophthalmologist (an ST or doctor's residency) who could not see the cause for the shadow. For instance, he noticed no retinal detachment and said my retina looks healthy. He dismissed it as a likely result of age-related vitreus detachment. I wonder if he mistakenly thought I was seeing a floater, which I already have plenty of.

This causes anxiety as I am afraid it would get worse and turn into a blind spot or grow in size. The ophthalmologist appeared uncertain, which does not ease my concern.

Do you have any idea what it might be?

38M vision complaints diagnosed "no pathology", soon followed by retinal detachment
I've been being seen frequently by ophthalmologists because I call to report any vision changes after having a right eye retinal detachment that was treated with scleral buckle (and gas bubble) January 4, 2022. Each time I've gone since April this year, they've found nothing, except for a June 30 trip to the ER where a black line in my left eye's vision was diagnosed as the vitreous separating from the retina, which is a detachment risk but resolved without that happening. I've kept having vision changes like long wavy floaters coming in from left peripheral vision, sight of the sky or white/light colored walls having dancing lights instead of being solid color, and clear distortions that seem like having water in front of my eyes.

A retina specialist examined my eyes on September 23 and told me "The good news for you is the same as the bad news: there's nothing wrong with your eyes." However, he never used a scleral depressor. Also, when the tech was getting me ready to see the doctor, he did the shine a light test and called in a different doctor because he saw something strange about them: this other doctor was supposed to determine whether it was an "APD" and he called it hippus. On no other doctor visit before or since have I had hippus instead of pupils looking normal.

On Friday, October 11 I noticed a gray shadow extending down from my left eye's peripheral vision, in which the text I was reading in a book was blurry (this is similar to diagonal gray lines I've noticed in my right eye's vision). I called my eye care and they said they'd send my message to triage, which didn't call me back. I called them back after the weekend and they finally offered me a first thing in the morning Wednesday (Oct 16) appointment. This was with a different retina specialist, who after looking at both eyes with a scleral depressor said my right eye is fine but the left has a retinal detachment. He said I could choose scleral buckle surgery or do pneumatic retinopexy, saying that 70% of patients don't need surgery and there's no risk of vision loss for those who do, so I accepted pneumatic retinopexy.

There were follow ups 1 day and 7 days later, where he found my left retina fully attached. I had to lie on my right side all the time from afternoon of Oct 16 until waking up on the morning of Oct 28. As soon as the gas bubble disappeared on the evening of Oct 28, my vision seemed good, but I was soon seeing floaters again. I sometimes even see a gray or even black dot floater when out in daylight, which is how my right retina detachment 2.75 years ago looked before expanding into a larger black area of vision loss. However, this keeps going away instead of rapidly progressing.

37M Eye pain
I poked my eye on something sharp about 2-3 years ago. Why does my eye now hurt whenever I am tired? It's fine the rest of the time but when I'm tired it hurts to look at light, my eye waters and it feels like there's something in it. I close my eye for 5/10 minutes and it settles.

35F white flash left eye
For the last two or so years I get occasional flashes in my left eye. It usually happens if I'm rolling over in bed or sometimes getting up from the couch - maybe pressure related? The flash can be seen if my eyes are closed or open. It seems to be the shape or the retinal - or at least part of it. Sort of a ring or half ring. What could this be? Happens maybe once a week.

40sM - Quick question regarding accidental UVB/UVA eye exposure and symptoms
Hey r/eyetriage, just wanted to run this by you out of curiosity. I have my regularly scheduled yearly eye exam in a few weeks anyway, but unfortunately Dr. Google got the better of me while I wait.

I have difficulty with side effects from Vitamin D supplements, so I used [Sperti UVB sun lamp]( occasionally in the winter. Not great for the skin obviously, but an unfortunate trade off with having chronically low Vitamin D off season. [It's mostly UVB wavelengths.](

Anyway, I always wear the eye goggles during my five minute sessions, however the strap broke yesterday when I was using it (it's cheap) and I ended up looking straight at the lamp fairly closely while fumbling around for the off switch. Only had maybe 5-6 seconds of actual UV light eye exposure, however I noticed a few hours later my eyes were light sensitive and I had some aching, although mild. It's been about 24 hours and they still ache and feel like eye strain. No redness or burns or anything like that, but they definitely have a mild ache.

I guess I'm just curious if a one off brief exposure to straight UV is anything to be concerned about. From what I'm reading a one off UV exposure like this should be self limiting and resolve 24-48 hours, so not a huge deal, just don't do it again or risk early cataracts or possible macular degeneration.

25M, Cloudy spots on cornea that changes their position slightly?
25m, south asian, normal BMI, was prescribed systematic steroids for my corneal ulcer along with anti biotics (5th time in last 7 years) 2 weeks ago, it got better but since then weird stuff keeps happening in my eye, yellowish/white-ish /brownish spots have appeared some of them are elevated, eyes feel dry and there's very mild pain,  today I spotted these cloudy spots too on my cornea while taking pics of my left eye, now I think I have steroid induced glaucoma. 
My vision is blur
These spots change their position a little bit on my cornea when my cornea moves, sometimes their shape too or atleast that's what I saw in different pics that I clicked. 

PS I have Agoraphobia and illness anxiety disorder, would really appreciate a well put answer 
PS+ apologies for my bad english

56M Metamorphopia post Vitrectomy/gas bubble surgery for detached retina
I’m a 56 year old male, no health issues, in pretty good physical shape (no smoking, gym) About 2 months ago, was sitting in my friends back yard on a Friday night, and asked them if they saw that lightning.  They said “there is no lightning”. I immediately knew I was probably having a detachment (5 years prior I was hit in the same eye and had cryotherapy, which repaired 2 tears and the floaters eventually.  disappeared).  Woke up Monday morning and the lower left field of vision was a grey smudge.  I immediately went to a retina specialist, and that Wednesday I was on the operating table,  vitrectomy and gas bubble.  1st two follow-ups, was told I was “ahead of the curve”. Sunday before my next follow up, experienced some weird visual acuity issues.  Saw the surgeon the next day and was told I need surgery again there is another tear a bit lower.  Now, after 8 weeks of annoying pain, headaches, I am a bit reluctant to just submit to additional surgery without explanation to the exact issue, which I’m now told is a scleral buckle and oil bubble.  This is also coupled with my original surgery by him as I’m in the waiting room, 2 other patients there saying they’re on their 2nd surgery with him…It’s been a week (I’m scheduled for surgery 3 days from now) and at this moment, the only visual issues I have is some minor metamorphopsia.  My visual field (peripheral) seems completely normal, no shadows or grey patches, or floaters, just a bit of metamorphopsia that I can deal with.  Needless to say, I scheduled a 2nd opinion diagnosis with a highly recommended retina group on the Monday before I supposed to have this 2nd procedure.    Is metamorphopsia normal after a vitrectomy?  Or is it a sign that my macula is now involved?  My first detachment was no where near the macula, as is my scar tissue from my previous tear repairs 5 years ago.

23F Episcleritis getting worse
I was diagnosed with episcleritis in my right eye by a doctor a few months ago. Probably 6. It was initially just one spot in my right eye which was a horrible flare up they gave me steroid drops. It went well and recovered very fast. I did have other flare ups after every few months but they were so mild and went away on their own. However this time around the month of had a horrific flare up. What's strange is it started with severe itching in the inner corners and outer ones of my eyelids even around my eyebrows. The itching caused the flare up to appear in the same spot but that became better on its own however the flare appeared on the outer corners of my eyes this time and much worse it was itchy and stingy...horrible. I went to another doctor opthalmogist who gave me mild steroid drops and asked for a follow up other than that he reassured that I don't have any autoimmune diseases so I'll be fine. However the flare up also appeared in the other eye just today..EXACTLY AFTER I HAD THIS ITCH in the outer corner..and now I'm using the drops in both eyes. I'm not sure but could this be something other than episcleritis it worries me.

32M - Bad vision in certain lighting conditions
Hi, firstly about me:
32M, caucasian, never had any problems with vision, no glasses. No drugs, alcohol socially. Former smoker, now I vape. Diagnosed with ulcerative colitis 4 years ago, treated with mesalazine. 


Few months ago, I’ve been experiencing occasional issues with my vision in certain situations, finding it difficult to focus. This usually happens when the lighting conditions are challenging. It’s hard to describe, so I’ll give a few examples: I was at the theater, where it was dark as usual, with only the stage brightly lit with red light. Throughout most of the performance, I couldn’t focus on the actors, seeing double and my eyes seemed to cross. Another situation is when I’m driving at night and there are many cars coming toward me with their lights on—it’s very distracting, I struggle to focus on the road, and it feels like I can’t see anything. Then, I had an experience where I was with a friend at a restaurant, sitting outside after dark. Behind my friend, there were some decorative lights hanging, some lanterns within my field of vision. They weren’t particularly bright or blinding, but they still made it difficult for me to focus on my friend, my vision was blurry, and again, my eyes felt crossed, to the point where I started feeling dizzy.

In normal conditions, I see well, and these situations only happen occasionally. Has anyone experienced something similar? I’m not even sure if this could be an eye condition—it seems odd that it only happens sometimes and under certain lighting conditions. Perhaps it’s related to something else entirely. But I feel it happens more and more often over time.  I've experienced  noticeable sensitivity to light

I am planning to try to get an appointment with ophtalmologist on Monday, I was just curious if anybody experienced something like this. I don’t expect to get the diagnosis here :))

Thanks!

1 Year Old, Hyperopia in one eye. Chance to improve?
My wife and I noticed that, at times, our daughter’s eye would turn inward, particularly in photos. During her checkups, her pediatrician told us not to worry. However, at her one-year appointment, they performed a screening test by taking a picture of her eyes, and she was subsequently referred to an eye specialist. The test revealed that she had hyperopia (farsightedness) in one eye.

We consulted a pediatric ophthalmologist, who confirmed the hyperopia diagnosis in one of her eyes. He recommended glasses and daily patching of her stronger eye for 30 minutes to support the weaker eye.

Her prescription is as follows:

* **Right Eye:** Sphere +1, Cylinder +0.25, Axis 180
* **Left Eye:** Sphere +4.25, no cylinder

Given that she was diagnosed at such a young age, is there a chance her vision might improve over time? Neither my wife nor I wear glasses.

26F Allergy/ High IgE and Dryness along with Corneal erosions
I got a corneal abrasion in my right eye in June and then I started getting recurrent corneal erosions. Doctor gave me lubricating drops and also placed a BCL in my eye. Three days ago I have started getting pain/ poking sensation in my left eye when I wake up. I use systane complete and a lubricating gel at night and still face this issue. Doctor told me to get my IgE levels tested. It came out as 616 whereas normal range is less than 100. My CRP is 7 which is also a little elevated. I think it means I have an allergy to something.

22F Leucokoria for one month
I (22F) have always had a white/yellowish reflection off my left eye in photos. It's always more reflective than my right eye. I've had about 5 dilations since the first photo was taken but never explicitly mentioned this issue because I have other things going on that I mention that get all the focus (flashes and floaters). I did mention this photo issue to the person that came before the doctor but idk if he got the memo.
I have anisometropia so I have terrible myopia in my left eye and perfect vision in my right eye. Idk if that's what's causing the different reflections.
Would the dilations have shown anything concerning even if I didn't explicitly mention that I'm seeing white reflections in my left eye in photos?

23F Dropped contacts, back in eye
Today, Series of unfortunate events. Broke my glasses, had to put in my contacts that don’t fit properly and always fall out, which is what ended up happening twenty minutes before my midterm (that I was already late to and rescheduled because I had to run back for my contacts when my glasses broke). It fell on a dry floor, but in a nasty university hallway. I was able to find and pick it up in a few seconds and then ran to buy a cleaner and some extra solution.

I got Bausch+Lomb Boston Advance cleaner and cleaned the lens according to instructions, then rinsed it with Optifree Puremoist. This is the part where I was stupid: I put the lens back in because I was freaking out over my midterm that I kind of needed to see to take.

I took it out an hour later, have cleaned it again and it is soaking in a Ziploc baggie of solution until I can get home and put it in my case. I rinsed out my eye thoroughly with Bausch+Lomb eye wash. My eye was irritated, but it usually is after I put in contacts because I’m still new to them and poke my eye out when I put them in. After a few flushes with the eye wash the irritation has mostly died down. I stopped by the optometrist today and their soonest appointment is on Monday.

My prescription:
OD: S-4.00 C-3.75 axis 170
OS: S-8.00 C-3.25 axis 005
Proclear Toric XR

Am I screwed? And would that lens still be safe for wear? It’s my last pair left, and since my glasses are broken I really need something right now. Thanks for any help and advice you guys can give.

23M flashes and black spots
M 23 I had recently had a back injury which has lead me to be bedridden so I’ve been on my phone everyday VERY often. Just few days ago I was dealing with dry eyes, when I have resolved but I’m getting these new symptoms. I see these very black circular shaped dots, it’s usually just 1-2 and they disappear instantly. They look much different from my normal eye floaters. When I stare at my roof or wall, I can see them better. It’s really odd because at times they almost seem pixelated. I’ve also been experience bright flash/light in form of a small circle also. These all happen when my eyes are open, I barley see them when closed.

I consulted with an eye doctor, and she saw no problems with my eyes. What could this be I’m facing? I go to see another eye doctor soon.

22 female- swelling on oct scan
I went to optimologist  cause was experiencing migraine with aura for the first time. The aura was like black spots in my vision followed by my peripheral vision going watery if that makes sense. Then I got hit with a bad headache. 

Optomologist said there was swelling behind my eye. She showed me the scan but didn’t tell me which nerve she was looking at. She just said on the nerve and she scrolled to the right of the eye. She said she needed to retake the photo of the left eye to see if it’s there too but she never said if it was or not. Also my astigmatism in my left eye has gotten worse in the last year from a -2.75 to a -5.5. My right eye vision is okay I think. She referring me to urgent care tomorrow. She did a peripheral vision test which was normal I think. 

What could this be?

28F Severe episodes of out of focus in near field after reading/be on computer
Hello all,

I would like to have an opinion since many ophthalmologists I have seen can’t help anymore.

Since very young (like 17y/o) I have been suffering from sporadic episodes where I read for a while and my eyes just go out of focus immediately. Those episodes are increasing more often and this year was the first time that I needed to have a sick leave in work because it was impossible for me to read at the computer… I am afraid I would need to give up of my career because of this problem. Your help/ experiences would be really helpful 

My clinical history:

* My glasses prescription for right and left eye:  &lt;PWR +2.25 CYL -3.00 AXIS 5&gt;
and &lt;PWR +2.75 CYL -3.25 AXIS 175&gt;

* eye structure seems to present no problems at all (already observed by multiple doctors)

* I have a lazy eye (left eye) but no strabism assesses. My vision with glasses with left eye is 6/10 and right eye 10/10. Honestly before this problem, my left eye was never a problem for me and I never noticed it.

* latent hyperopia: after a cyclopgenic test they found a residual hyperopia of 1D in each eye. I tried using glasses with +0.5D but didn’t help..my far distance was a mess.

* one doctor suggested ciliar spams and prescribed atropine to help…the result was really bad I over reacted to it and I spent almost 2 weeks to recover my vision in near field. The only good thing from this was to realize that atropine provided me the same effect that my crisis does. I’m just not able to focus at all..(and usually is my left eye which start it) 

* during the atropine test, I bought some reading glasses with +3.00 +2.00 and +1.00 for different distances. I never tried to use it in a crises but looks like it works..

* I just don’t associate my crises to stress, I would say they happen more when I spend a lot of hours at phone and brightness looks like a trigger as well (not sure about this last one)..I think I have been controlling the frequency of them by 1) increasing the computer screen size and 2) avoiding reading at night / watching tv/ be at phone. Honestly this is making my life a mess because I really like near work activities, but I’m just living to try saving my eyes to job activities. 

Any help/ experience sharing would be amazing…at this point I don’t know what I should do to save my vision.

Thanks in advance!

31M Episcleritis with Sinusitis, autoimmune related possibly, dry eye involvement
Hello,

Having a hard time for 3-4 months with a flare-up of eye symptoms that I believe are a recurrence of past episodes of autoimmune related eye problems. Hoping someone can offer insight.



History:

I've had RCE (7 episodes, occurring in alternation in left/right eye about 1 year apart) for last 12 years. ABMD has been observed, as well as MGD. My most recent CE occured Jan. 2024. I used Muro ointment several times/day for 2 months, then used the ointment only nightly once the pain and blurred vision reduced. I changed from glasses to contact lens, under advice of optometrist, to help normalize the irregular surface of my cornea from RCE. I was pain/redness symptom free for 6 months while using Muro nightly and daily soft lens contacts.



Current Symptoms:

July 2024 I had an autoimmune disease flare up (dx Ulcerative Colitis and Psoriatic Arthritis since 2019). In tandem with abdominal symptoms and joint symptoms flaring, I had chronic sinusitis (no infection noted, yet CT scan shows thickening of sinuses on left side) and left eye pain/redness/blurred vision/floaters. These eye symptoms are unresolved for 3.5 months now, causing work outage and a lot of general frustration with the pain and loss of vision acuity. The sinus inflammation presents in tandem with worsening of eye pain/redness, making me believe there is a common source.

ANA, CRP, SED Rate, ANCA testing all non-elevated. Doing further evaluations to rule out Sjogren's.

I discontinued wearing contacts, and am doing MGD home treatments, hot compresses and lid cleaning. I use eyedrops 5-10x/day. I started restasis 2x/day, have been taking for 3 weeks. I suspect some of the eye symptoms are related to dry eye because of the MGD, which has been observed in my left eye as more severe than the right. I may do IPL or other dry eye treatments if advised by next ophthalmologist.

Episcleritis was observed in my left eye as well. The level of pain has me wondering if it is potentially scleritis, although I don't have sensitivity to light. I read that both can be tied to sinusitis. Any thoughts on how I should go about further diagnosing and treating?

I'm floundering in the healthcare system. Really no one wanting to stick with the story of my history, and investigate the connection between sinusitis, eye symptoms, and the other autoimmune symptoms occurring in tandem.

I started Skyrizi and Methotrexate 2 months ago. Each has shown improvement in joint and abdominal symptoms, but my eye symptoms remain unchanged.



Thanks for taking a look

18M Vision won't improve even with glasses
Hello, 18M here. I've been having issues with my vision for about two years now, and I don't know what to do about it anymore. My issue mainly appears when reading; it feels like the letters aren't sharp enough and there's not enough contrast with the paper or screen; the letters don't seem to "pop out" so to speak, and it feels like my eyes aren't properly focusing on the text. Lately, I’ve started experiencing similar issues when watching TV or looking at things from a distance.

When I first started having trouble reading, I thought it was just me needing glasses for the first time, so I went to an optometrist and got some prescription glasses. They did help for a few weeks, but after that, the same uncomfortable feeling appeared again, it got to the point where wearing the glasses felt worse than just trying to read without them. From there I decided to improve eye-health habits (20-20-20 rule and so), but it didn't help much.

Nine months after getting my first glasses, I decided to see an ophthalmologist. He diagnosed me with keratitis and dry eye, prescribed an ointment and eye drops, and referred me to an affiliated optometrist, who made new glasses for me. Unfortunately, these new glasses also didn’t work.

After that, I focused on curing the keratitis and wearing eye drops when my eyes felt dry, which I still do, but unfortunately that did not improve things either. 6 months later, I went to an optometrist who said I had convergence issues (and also hadn't integrated some reflexes like Moro. I started doing vision therapy. I started vision therapy, which included exercises like pencil push-ups, using a Brock string, and tracking colored balls on a screen while wearing anaglyph glasses. I did weekly sessions for three months and 30 minutes of exercises at home each day, but I didn’t notice any improvement.

After seeing no results for so long, I felt discouraged and decided to stop, as the therapy was expensive, and I didn’t want my parents paying for something that wasn’t helping.

Most recently, I was on a trip to Japan and decided to get some new glasses, there are shops where they do an extensive eye test for you and make glasses in a really short amount of time. I explained my situation and showed my previous glasses. The shopkeeper said my old glasses were more suited for distance vision, not reading, which was what I needed. She also tested whether I needed prisms and said that while I could probably wear prisms, the correction was minimal.

These glasses are the ones I have the most improvement with, but I can't still see as clearly and effortlessly as I recall doing years ago.

Finally, about a week ago, I went to another ophthalmologist. She said everything looked fine with my eyes internally. She also checked my prescription against my previous glasses and told me the latest prescription was incorrect, which surprised me since those glasses helped the most.

She has recommended I keep improving my eye health habits, and I intend on doing so, but this is extremely frustrating. I use up so much energy just trying to make the letter sharper, which affects both my concentration and my reading speed, which is much slower than it used to be.

I would be grateful if anyone here could provide any feedback about what is going on here.

Here's my prescription for the first two glasses and the one that the last ophthalmologist gave me; unfortunately, I don't have the one for the glasses I made overseas.

First Glasses:
Right eye:

\*Axis: 120 Cilinder: -0,75 Distance: +0,25 Visual Acuity: 1.0

Left eye:

\*Axis: 160 Cilinder: -0,5 Distance: +0 Visual Acuity: 1.0

Second glasses: 
\*Right Eye:

\*Axis: 110**°** Cylinder: -0,50

\*Left Eye: \*Axis: 170**°** Cylinder: -0,50 Sphere: -0,25

Measurement from a week ago:
Right Eye:

* Distance Vision (VL)
   * Axis (EIX): 140°
   * Cylinder (CIL):-0.50
* Near Vision (VP):

Left Eye:

* Distance Vision (VL)
   * Axis (EIX): 170°
   * Cylinder (CIL): -0.25
   * Sphere (ESF): -0.50
* Near Vision (VP):

TLDR: I've gotten three prescription glasses, done vision therapy for convergence issues, and gone to two different ophthalmologists, but I still can't read comfortably.

18M - Chronic Eye Strain for a year
Chronic eye strains - Doctors prescriber +.25 glasses. First time I wore them, all eye pain literally vanished. Lasted for 2 days, screen time was average.

Staying in front of my pc for 2 hours, in a sunday morning, and, for a month since, even using my glasses my eye strains are still present.

How come my issue was solved for only 2 days? I suffer from this from a year now.

28F Help, anyone know what this is?
Hi. I’m 28F, Wasian and 33 weeks pregnant. Last Monday, I felt a tingling/burning sensation under my eyelid. As I got home the pain got worse; the following days were even worse as it started to develop small bumps, which turned into open lesions looking like a flesh eating bacteria had infested my under eye. 

Since we initially thought it was an allergic reaction, it never went away instead got worse, I went to Ophthalmologist on Thursday and DR prescribed NeoPolyDex Ointment (steroid) and confirmed it was not Ocular Herpes as there is no damage to the cornea or conjunctiva and symptoms do not present as such. 

Before I could get the NeoPolyDex from pharmacy, my eye was closed shut Friday morning so my husband brought me to ER where they used lamp and dye to check my eye; they also confirmed it is not Ocular Herpes nor Eye Shingles. They prescribed amoxicillin (safe for pregnancy per the ER DR) which I have been taking for 4 days now, they also prescribed Erythromycin ointment which I haven’t been using since the NeoPolyDex seems to be doing it’s job and helping with the burning/itching sensation (I’ve been using since Friday late noon).

I personally can see improvement but was wondering if anyone has ever seen or experienced this and what it could possibly be? I’m only more concerned due to my pregnancy and my OB couldn’t do anything for me. At the ER, I asked for a swab to be sent for review but they never did one. Based off my research I’m thinking staph infection but I could be wrong. I’m waiting a couple more days to finish antibiotics to decide whether or not I should see a dermatologist since both ER and Eye DR advised so if it doesn’t heal after 4 days. 

Thanks so much in advance. Here are progress pictures.

18M,seeing multiple images through eyeglasses.
Hello.18M,South Asian,have been using eyeglasses for the past 2-3 years. Few days ago, I had to change my glasses due to my power increasing(myopia) but whenever I use these new glasses I see multiple images of certain objects, particularly light sources.Is this an issue on the manufacturer's side or do I need to get my eyes checked again?

50F Visual Field Test
I had a visual field test last Friday and got the results today. It said I have vision loss in each eye towards my nose. They want me to retake it. I’m wondering if I did it wrong. Should I press the button even when I don’t see the pinpoint of light, but just a blobby blurry area of light too? I only pressed it for the pinpoint lights on my right eye, which were all on the right side of the dome. On the left side I just saw blurry blobs of light.  I also kept forgetting to look at the center and was looking all over the dome for the lights. On my left eye it was completely dark on the side toward my nose so I never pressed on that side. Does this sound like user error? I do have a 4.6 mm pituitary adenoma.

25F blue sclera from xray?
So recently my boyfriend noticed my scleras were like really blue?! The day before I had went to a dentist appointment and the doctor told me he was going to take photos of my teeth, but I was never directed to take my contacts out he just handed me glasses to put on and the xray lasted about 10 seconds a day after that's when my boyfriend noticed my eyes and claims they never were this blue and I also never noticed it and I'm assuming it's probably from my contacts being in while doing that xray because my contacts do have a blue tint to them or my contacts are just dying into my eyes somehow or I just always had this? Pls let me know what you think? (no way to show it but to describe it’s a blue tinted ring around my iris when I lift my upper lid on both sides and still some white more at the back of my eyeball )

8M | Child Wakes Screaming in Pain Saying Eyes Hurt
Age: 8 | Sex: Male | Height: 48 inches | Weight: appx 55lbs | Race: White | Duration of complaint: 3+ years | Location (Geographic and on body): Eyes | Current medications (if any): Quillivant, Guanfacine (ADHD)

**Issue:** my son, 8M, has been waking up in the middle of the night for several years screaming that his eye hurts. When I say screaming, I mean really screaming. I usually end up getting a hot washcloth and putting it on his eye and calming him down. This seems to work.

**History:** he was born with clogged tear ducts. He had two surgeries to fix this, first was just prodding the duct, which didn't work. The second was to put stents in the eye which seemed to work. The stent was removed in office a few months later.

He has also had multiple scratches to his cornea. One from his sister, one from himself, one from the dog. I have no idea why this has happened to him so many times, but it has and each time we go to urgent care, they confirm the scratch, give drops and he seems fine.

**Question:** We have gone to Wilmers Eye Institute and shared this with his pediatrician. Wilmers said there is nothing wrong with his eyes and it's possible he's sleeping with his eye slightly open and it's drying out his eye and sticking to his eye lid. I don't notice his eyes open when he sleeps, but I have no idea what else this can be. It happens maybe once every 2-3 months and it's very scary when it happens.

**Should I be concerned? Should I take him for a third opinion? Should I look into getting an MRI or other scan to see if there's something going on behind his eyes**

Thank you for any advice

37f Acanthamoeba Keratitis years ago and now have mild double vision?
I had a very bad AK today infection back in 2009. I had eye ulcers and barely any vision for 6 months until I finally saw a doc that diagnosed it on the spot.  I had no lasting vision effects once the infection was treated. A lot of scar tissue but just below the visual field so I lucked out.  I just went yesterday for my annual eye exam and when I covered my right eye, I saw an overlapping image of the screen with the letters on it.  I don’t have it in my right eye at all and don’t see the image when looking with both eyes. The optometrist said scars can change over the years so maybe now it’s spreading into the visual field. I’m waiting for an appt with a corneal specialist but has anyone heard of a scar changing 15 years later?  Is there anything else that could cause this without any other issues?

31F 6 months with subepithelial infiltrates (SEIs) in one eye
Back in April 2024, I noticed my right eye became extremely red, blurred vision, light sensitive, also headaches. I went to an optometrist in early May who said I caught an infection, prescribed prednisoLONE acetate 1 %, to take 1 drop 3 times a day for 10 days; it cleared up everything except the blurred vision. I assumed my vision changed and got my glasses updated to no avail.

I visited an ophthalmologist in August (which I should've originally did) and that's when she did a full eye screening and noted the SEIs and told me it would just take time and didn't advise on if I should discontinue contact use or anything to help. Now, it's October and the eye is still blurry ,red and also very sensitive to sunlight when driving. I am wondering if I should revisit the second doctor, and all of my research so far suggests continued steroid drop usage could prolong it. Has anyone experienced SEIs for this long? I just keep hoping one day I'll wake up and my eyesight is back to normal.

Edit: Also would like to add that my right eyelid is slightly droopy now as well. The ophthalmologist said it's from lifting my eye and applying contacts but it's only the eye with the SEIs. I'm also pretty responsible with my contacts; I have never slept in them, I remove/clean them at the end of wear and don't wear them super consistently throughout the week.

18M, ghosting vision
I'll make it as short as possible. I was born healthy like any person without any eye conditions. About a year ago it was summer and I started having too much screen time. I started to see a slightly double vision. By that I mean everything I see has a double image of itself with a low opacity right at it's edge especially if it is a white object on a black surrounding. It started getting worse as my screen time increased day by day. Fast forward to last week,  I got checked at an ophthalmologist and I was told that I have eye dryness and they prescribed an eye drop(artificial tear so they say) named, Sodium Carboxy methyl cellulose and glycerine eye drops. Here's the problem, when I got to the refractive check to get a glass for my computer use they said I had a sight -0.5 distance vision(attached) on my right eye but they said my left eye was fine. But actually it was both my eyes. Plus, whether it was from a close range or a long range the double vision is the same. My question here is, what do you recommend me to do?

28 F. First exam in 2-3 yrs. Went from -3.25/-2.75 to -2/-1.5?
ETA: I'm just now realizing it might not be normal for my eyes/forehead to only feel "relaxed" when my contacts are not in. I thought that was just a sensory thing, or me not wanting to fully accept the horrors of reality lol 

My prescription has been slowly creeping upwards since childhood. My current contacts were NOT dysfunctioning... Unless I've been mistaking random blurriness for just having them in too long? I will call my doc today to at least express my concerns.

I didn't like my last doctor, I felt rushed and it was my first time with a different Rx in each eye. I stuck with the Rx anyways. I didn't want to bring my old prescription to my new exam years later, to influence it. That said, now that I got the new prescription, I'm a bit worried about how different it is? 

It doesn't feel like it would make sense for me to be able to still see safely. Won't I have nearly half the "eyesight" as before? Would it even be possible for me to *not* notice that my prescription was previously almost twice as high as it maybe should have been? In all fairness, because I'm autistic, I likely genuinely wouldn't notice a slight difference until I ran into something or ended up in the hospital... I'm really wanting to trust my doctors here, but struggling due to my lack of medical schooling and body-interpretation issues. 

I'm waiting on a trial period to come in in the new Rx, but as bad as my light/night issues are already, I'm legit afraid to be dependent on such a much lower description for driving until I understand better. At the same time, maybe my Rx was too high and *contributing* to my migraines, light sensitivity, etc...? I have other contributing health issues, but maybe this is why I sometimes felt like I had to "choose between seeing or feeling comfortable?"

27F  LA’s totally awesome concentrated degreaser splashed in eye
Basically title, but I was holding the bottle and the lid fell off. The bottle fell straight on the ground and splashed up into my face (eye and mouth). It was a significant amount, but unsure how much got in my eye. I immediately started flushing for 15 minutes and it’s still really red/ sore. I can see normally but there’s slight pain when blinking. 

 Is this normal? Should I go to the doctor?
##########
21M Anyone what this is?
From my research It appears to be pinguecula or pterygium. But i've also have had an increase in eye floaters and didn't want it to be something severe and let it go. Since the spring I have blinking more consciously and like blinking and holding for a second. I thought it was just stress but then i noticed this raised bump and figured I’d ask around.
I have been diagnosed with nearsightedness in the past

42F with Bilateral Monocular Diplopia – Looking for New Ideas
Hi all,

I’m a 42-year-old Caucasian woman with 20/20 vision, but for the past two years, I've been experiencing persistent monocular diplopia in both eyes. I do not experience them as shadows, but rather more like if you hold something too close to your crossed eyes and they appear as double. I also see occasional light flashes in the corners of my eyes. Despite seeing multiple specialists (at home and Johns Hopkins), including neuro-ophthalmologists, and getting extensive testing (eye scans, MRIs, blood work), the results have all been normal except for:

* **Borderline peripapillary nerve fiber layer** (left eye)
* **VEP at upper limits** (but still normal)
* **Slightly elevated ANA, CRP, and MVP** in some blood tests
* I do have **a mild cataract** but docs say "it isn't consistent with my symptoms"

Doctors have not found these results concerning, but I’m mentioning them since they’re the only borderline findings.

# Symptoms &amp; Background

* **No pain or migraines**, but I occasionally experience painless ocular migraines.
* **Dry eye syndrome**, but pinhole test was negative and persistent unchanging diplopia is inconsistent with this being the cause.
* **Focus issues from near to far**, especially with screens and signs (think looking at my phone and then up at a scoreboard for sports or a gate screen at the airport)
* **COVID &amp; Herpes Zoster Connection:** My symptoms began after having COVID, followed by a herpes zoster outbreak. During the outbreak, my right eye twitched uncontrollably, and eventually both eyes began twitching, accompanied by severe photosensitivity. I was treated with 30 days of acyclovir, which stopped the twitching but left me with persistent eye fatigue, especially when using screens. Blue light glasses helped reduce some of the discomfort, but if I don’t wear them, the twitching returns.
* **Brain Fog Episodes:** On some days, I experience severe brain fog, where my thinking slows down, and I feel barely functional. This often happens after I’ve overexerted myself. It’s sometimes accompanied by an unusual sense of euphoria. I usually need to sleep to recover, and this issue only started after my vision changes.
* **C1-C2 Spinal Fusion:** I also have a C1-C2 spinal fusion after having os odontoideum, which does not seem relevant to my symptoms.

# Treatments Tried

* Anti-seizure meds (gabapentin, Topamax)
* Prednisone course
* ACT and CBT therapy
* Syntonic phototherapy
* Hard/scleral contact lenses, prisms, readers, blue light glasses
* Restasis for dry eye
* Autoimmune Protocol diet

**Seeking Help**

I run a nonprofit and have four kids, so these symptoms are really affecting my daily life. I’m working with Bascom currently, but they aren't hopeful that they can find anything new. I’m hoping someone here might have suggestions or has experienced something similar.

Any ideas or out-of-the-box thoughts are welcome. Thank you for reading and for any guidance you can offer!

Edited to add: I am not on prescription medication. I was on Wellbutrin when diplopia began and ceased it to rule it out as a cause as it started after I increased the dose. I have been off it for 6 months with no change in vision. I take vitamins B and D3/K12 daily, and occasionally Magnesium to help me sleep. I do not smoke or use drugs. I quit drinking for 6 months, but after it made no difference, I started again. I have a few drinks a week (1-2 drinks 1-2xs per week). I exercise 3-4 times per week and eat a very healthy diet.

26F Recurring corneal dellen for over a year
I'm a white woman, not on any medications, not pregnant, no chronic illnesses. I work in a biochem lab but I have no significant occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals. 

Last year I developed an indentation on my cornea which is most prominent in the morning right after waking up. Even when the indent is not visible, my eye stings in that spot (sometimes so badly that I have to close my eye) and red veins are noticeable. It has healed for a few weeks before and then reappeared. When it first appeared I lived in a windy seaside area and was getting sand blown in my eyes daily, which I suppose could be relevant. I also spend WAY too much time looking at screens. 

In February I saw an ophthalmologist, who examined my eye with fluorescein and diagnosed me with corneal dellen and prescribed Corneregel. That helps with pain immediately after application, but it did not help resolve the issue. She said the dellen should be gone in a few months, but I still have it after over a year and have not seen much improvement.

 Is there anything I can do to fix it or am I stuck with it forever? Is this really a corneal dellen or something more serious? Is my eye at risk for complications?

32F cluster of small black dots in right eye vision
Hello, 32 year old African American female

About a week ago I woke up from a nap and saw a tight circular cluster of moving small black dots in the middle of the vision of my right eye. It faded after a few blinks. This morning I woke up and saw a diamondish shaped cluster of the small dots in my right eye again that quickly faded away

Googling only shows floaters which is not what this was. Does jt sound like anything to anyone? TIA

29F, Pre-Phthisical Eye
Pre-Phthisical Eye

Hi, I’ll try to make this as succinct as possible, but I have a long history of eye issues. I’m 29F. Born at 28 weeks and had cryotherapy in my left eye due to ROP. In 1999 I was diagnosed with JIA and then uveitis a few months later in 2000. In 2001, I had a par plana victrectomy and lensectomy in my left eye, the surgeon also repaired a retinal hole and suppressed the cillary body due to glaucoma. My vision was CF since then and they didn’t put a lens back in. 

I also developed band keratopathy in that eye and had 2 EDTA chelations in 2010 and 2014. Had a corneal abrasion from the 2014 surgery. Sometime around 2015 or so I developed hypotony in that eye. It’s gradually shrunk over the years. Had a healon injection in 2019 to increase the pressure but it didn’t work. An exudative retinal detachment was noticed in 2021. It’s been monitored since then.

Now, I have a multifactorial retinal detachment in that eye with a funnel shape and PVR. My doctor said he feels that surgery would be too risky, but referred me for a second opinion.

I’ve luckily had no pain in that eye, but it feels like I’m near the end of this eye functioning. It seems like once it becomes painful, then it would be removed. I’m fine with that, but the waiting has been hard. The second opinion is in December. Have you ever seen a case like this? What would you do - surgery or just wait for the eye to give up? 

My right eye has 20/25 vision and been stable for the past 10 years, though I developed glaucoma as a kid and had multiple surgeries, I got an implant device in 2012 and my pressure has been stable since.

FWIW, I see a uveitis specialist, glaucoma specialist, and a retinal specialist. 

I take cellcept 2000mg, inflectra every 6 weeks, durezol and atropine in the left eye.

30F Slight double vision normal in extreme gaze?
As background, I was diagnosed with mild myasthenia gravis 3 years ago, MGF2a, so mainly ocular / facial. Symptoms started 5 years ago. Currently well controlled, however, I have residual double vision in extreme gaze (last 15% of my vision, worse on the right hand side). Always there, does not fatigue with use, wake up with it, go to bed with it. 

Now obviously, before being diagnosed I wasn’t checking my vision in extreme gazes so not sure whether this has always been like this. Neurologist says most likely not my MG since not fatiguable at all. Since I was treated so late in my MG journey, my neuro theorised that my eye muscles most likely got weak / atrophied. 

So now my question - would this be possible? Is normal gaze in extreme gaze physiologically normal? 

Thanks so much!

21M bright flashes of light sometimes when I’m trying to sleep
As the title says, I’ve been getting these few days ago. It doesn’t happen whatsoever when I’m awake during the day or when I close my eyes when the lights are on. Only happens when I close my eyes and it’s dark and I try to sleep. No floaters and no blurry vision, so I’m a little confused because I thought retinal detachment occurs when the flashes happen at any time, but this is solely at night in the dark.

55F Retinal tear/detachment??
Is it retinal tear/detachment?? Is my mom going blind?

My mom is 55 years old, and one of her eye suddenly has a dark patch appeared, which covered 1/5 of her vision is her affected eye.

My sibling has brought my mom to the doctor already, and did some check up. After the check up, the doctor diagnosed it’s just floaters, but it doesn’t not sit right with me, because they forgot to tell the doctor all the important symptoms my mom is experiencing!! I will describe her symptoms below

- The dark patch came after a she felt a sudden flash of light in her affected eye. It’s not actual flashlight shined towards her eyes.
- The shape of the patch is not a circle/small/cell/fly like shape, it’s a somewhat half circular patch at the left side bottom corner which covered 1/5 of her sight
- The patch does not move along with her eye movements. It just sits at the bottom of her eye.
- Her affected eye got itchy after the patch appears
- The patch is somewhat translucent, which get lighter and darker sometimes
- the patch got darker and bigger after eye rubbing, but the patch got lighter and kinda ‘disappeared’ for now

I’m not a medical professional, but all these symptoms are not like floaters at all? I’m worried it’s an emergency and the doctor misdiagnosed it.

Edit to add: it appeared on 25/10(four days ago), by the time I was home after working and knew it, she was already asleep. I brought her to the ER on 26/10 because someone I knew said it might be retinal detachment. The ER doctor said it might be a retinal hole but they have no equipments to check, and the ophthalmologist office was closed on weekends, so the doctor helped us to book a ophthalmologist appointment today. After the check up today, the ophthalmologist said it’s just floaters, which I’m skeptical of.

40F, Scleral buckle, issues with wounds in front of eyes
Hi everyone. I had a scleral buckle surgery for retinal detachment about 4 weeks ago. In the last 2 weeks I’ve been struggling with some wounds in the front part of my eye on the sclera (close to sutures) and it’s causing me a lot of pain and cluster headaches. 

Anybody also experienced this and have some advice? 

Thanks

33 M, left eye out of focus after blunt trauma
Hi,
On Tuesday I received damage to my left eyeball due to blunt trauma ( a knuckle to the soul window), and since then my vision in that eye has been unfocused. I visited the local optometrist who ruled out detached retina and prescribed me to trade for 5 days. There's pain but otherwise the eyeball looks normal. Except for the blurry vision. 

Is this normal to occur after blunt trauma (this is my second time getting punched in the eye on the same eye but the first time nothing really happened). Does the vision return to normal? Should I get a second opinion?

35F possible permanent damage after cosmetic procedure. Vision changes and discomfort for 1 month
35F, active, 5’3” 110 lbs. No smoking anything, no alcohol, no drugs. No allergies, medications, or health conditions. I do wear glasses and contact lenses with a -3.50 prescription, my prescription has been the same for over 10 years. My lenses are dailies and I switch to glasses as soon as I get home from work, get my yearly eye exam, etc.

One month ago I went to a med spa for a cosmetic procedure. My face was numbed with a topical anesthetic administered by a RN. The anesthetic was left on for about 30 min. I later found out this was a compounded anesthetic (20% Lidocaine, 10% Benzacaine 10% Tetracaine) that is not FDA-approved. I didn’t feel anything go in my eye and didn’t notice anything amiss until I left the office (about 70 min after anesthetic was applied). I noticed that the street lamps had rainbow halos and my vision was blurred. The lights from cars driving past were glaring and my eyes felt very sensitive to light. I called the med spa (they were already closed) and left a message letting them know what I was experiencing. I should have gone to the ER but thought maybe I was overreacting, so I figured I’d just sleep it off.

The next morning I had lots of sticky white discharge coming out of my eyes and itchiness in the corners. My vision was still blurred but better than the previous night. The next day my vision was the same, so I made an appt to see my ophthalmologist the following day (3 days after the incident). My vision was still cloudy but I could read the letters on the chart and he said my eyes looked physically ok; my corneas were a little swollen but that my vision should be back to normal within 2 weeks. Did not go home w any medication. 2 weeks went by and while my daytime vision and the itchiness improved (vision 80% better, itchiness got better w every passing day and is no longer an issue) I noticed that at night I was still seeing rainbow halos, rays, and glares. I hadn’t been wearing my contacts this entire time to let my eyes heal so I didn't worry too much since things were improving like he'd said. Then I wore contacts once and was surprised it hurt when I initially put them in; they felt scratchy, like I had grit in my eye. Everything was fine for an hour but suddenly my vision got very cloudy and I could barely see. I wanted to see if it’d get better so I wore them for a few more hours, but then the rainbow halos, rays and glares seemed even worse than they were w glasses. The lamps in my home and even the moon had halos. I threw out the contacts and put on my glasses, and while the halos/rays/glares immediately lessened, they lasted for a few hours. If I only wear glasses, I am still sensitive to bright light, and there are rays and glares from street lamps and headlights, but it's to a much lesser degree than with contacts, and I do not see rainbow halos.

Went back to see my dr; he examined my eyes again and said he didn’t see any physical damage but that I could have microscopic injuries. He sent me home w Lotemax SM to use 3x/day for 2 weeks, told me to return if my vision hadn’t gotten back to normal by then and to wear my contacts at my next appt so he could see if there was any difference (the previous appts I wore glasses). This Monday will be 2 weeks since my last appt and there's been zero difference in my vision. I’m really worried that this is permanent. Should I see another provider, or is there anything else I can do? I know I should have gone to the ER right away and immensely regret that I didn’t. 

**TLDR:** RN accidentally got a compounded numbing cream that **isn’t** FDA-approved (20% Lidocaine, 10% Benzacaine 10% Tetracaine) in my eyes during a cosmetic procedure. Was not aware of anything amiss until one hour after application as I was driving home (saw rainbow halos, glares, rays, lights were hurting my eyes and vision was blurry). Did not go to ER. Did not try to rinse out my eyes until 3 days after incident. I used my kitchen faucet and the water hurt as it entered my eyes. Saw eye dr 3 days after incident, he said my eyes looked physically ok, I could read the letters ok, and that I’d be fine within 2 weeks. 2 weeks passed, vision still bad esp at night (glares, rays, sensitivity to bright light) and esp w contact lenses on (feels like there’s grit in my eye, horrible blurred vision, worse night vision w rainbow halos and symptoms all previously mentioned) returned and got Lotemax SM to use for 2 weeks. Again said everything looked fine but thought I might have microscopic injuries. He told me to come back in 2 weeks if I’m still experiencing vision issues and to wear my contacts at next exam if I come back. 2 weeks are almost up and my vision is still the same and this is really affecting my quality of life. I found articles in PubMed discussing the dangers of compounded anesthetics like the one that was used on me. I was not aware it was a compounded anesthetic until after the incident. Would like your thoughts, thank you.

27F, Eye pain on left
Hi!
I have been experiencing left eye pain for fews days . Have not done anything about it. 
I use glasses and have been since I was a little child. 
It hurts when blinking and when looking down. 
Have tried eyedrops, felt no relieve whatsoever. 
If it matters, started after I got Invisalign? Doubt it has anything to do with it. 
I have been using Otravin for a long time if that matters somehow
Any idea?

23F ocular hypertension, atrophy, enlarged discs
Few days ago, I had an optometrist tell me once at my eye exam and again at my follow up that pressure in my eye is a 23. My discs are enlarged (.7). And I have a little bit of atrophy in my left eye. She said to come back next year to check again. I couldn’t ask many questions because I’m not sure what to ask and she said she’s not very concerned. But should I try to see someone else for another opinion? I just don’t want anything to be brushed off if this could be indicative of an underlying issue.

30F experiencing sudden blurry vision in my right eye. I'm concerned. :(
Hi, I'm looking for some advice on sudden vision changes I’ve been experiencing over the last two days. 

Two days ago, I noticed some blurriness in my right eye. The blurriness isn’t severe, but my eyesight in that eye definitely dropped practically overnight, with things looking noticeably less sharp now. My main issue is with focusing—when I try to read text, the longer I focus, the blurrier it gets. If I close my eyes for a bit, my vision improves slightly, but then it blurs up again when I keep reading.

I’ve noticed that my vision is much sharper when I’m looking outside, especially in brighter light, and I see things quite clearly then. But indoors, I feel like things look a bit fuzzy, especially when reading or watching TV. It’s like I keep having one second of clear vision and then another of blurriness, and I’ve never had this problem before.

Some extra info: I don't wear glasses or contact lenses. I do have astigmatism in my left eye, and now my vision in my right eye isn’t much better than my left. My right eye still sees a bit sharper, but it used to be noticeably clearer. Both my eyes feel very watery, and sometimes there’s mild burning and dryness, but no severe pain. My eyes look normal from the outside—no redness or swelling.

I plan to see an eye doctor next Monday, but I’d like to know if this sounds serious. I asked my parents for advice, but they don’t take my concerns about this sudden change in vision seriously and think I’m overreacting. However, every eye doctor I’ve spoken to online has told me it’s important to get this checked out.

Is it okay to wait until Monday, or should I see an eye doctor sooner? Also, could sudden blurriness, especially when reading, be caused by dry eyes, or is it usually a sign of something more serious? Thanks for any insight!

18M tiny pink thing at the edge of my iris

I wear two week contact lenses every day and for the past four days around evening my right eye always started to feel irritated. At first i thought it was just because i didn’t clean the lens enough so i took them both out for night and put them back on in the morning. Since it didn’t work, not even the second time i just changed the right lens for a new one. it didn’t work so i examined my eye a little more and realized i have this little pink bastard at the edge of my iris. Its barely noticable but it is there. 
I did some research but couldn’t find anything that would look the same. Help me out, should i just stop wearing lenses for a while and see if it goes away or do you think its more severe and i should see eye doctor? Do you have any ideas what it could be? 
By the way i don’t feel it without my lenses and it also does affect the surface of my eye (its creating a tiny bulge or whatever should i call it in english)

22m, Chronic Pink Eye?
Hello, I think I have chronic pink eye and I can’t get rid of it no matter how many eye doctors I see, I’m always prescribed an eye drop with steroid with like an antibiotic in it, but this just never goes away, it’ll clear up but always come back a couple days later, I honestly have no idea what to do. 

I will say though I’ve seen 3 optometrist and it’s always the same thing and I try my best to keep to the regimen they tell me to follow, but then I don’t follow up with them for whatever reason and I end up using the whole bottle until I need to go see the eye doctor again idk why this is like this and I’m not sure what to do it just doesn’t go away I’ve had this for like two years now.

I sit here now hoping my Genteal eye drops will help but nope. I saw the doctor (not an optometrist) a couple days ago Monday and she told me to just see if it’s gonna come back red which it is now I sit in front of my mirror as my eye slowly is getting red unless I go and get that prescription eye drop and the cycle begins again… 

Just sort of venting but… yeah

33F stopped wearing prisms. How long until back to normal?
I have been trialing neurolens for 3 months now and haven’t noticed any relief from eye strain. I stopped wearing them 3 days ago and feel super dizzy especially in busy environments. How long before my eyes go back to a baseline? My script was +.25, 1.9 base in prism. Started out with .7BI, then up to 1.4, then 1.9. A few drs said I didn’t even need prism at all so I’m just confused

26F Bizarre Eyelid Sensation Inner Corner - Last Resort
Hi all- coming here as a last resort. I’m 26F who has been dealing with an issue around my right eye for nearly a year now. One day in December 2023 I woke up with a sort of puffy or heavy sensation in the inner corner of my right eye on the eyelid. It doesn’t hurt, isn’t red or itchy. At first I thought it might be drooping but from a visual look, everything is totally normal. I feel the sensation in the inner corner eyelid especially when I blink, and the sensation varies depending on which direction my eyeball is facing. The only way I can fall asleep without this feeling distracting me is by wearing a slightly weighted eye mask. Sometimes I feel like there is just a bit of fluid built up in the area but idk how to get it out? 

What I’ve done for evaluation: I’ve seen two primary docs, a neurologist, an ENT, and one of the best ophthalmologists in town. Note that I have Graves Disease but it is well under control and has been for years. None of the doctors can figure out the issue. My CT scans and an MRI were clear. I do have dry eyes but use drops for them. I am nearsighted and my vision hasn’t declined since this started. My ophthalmologist doesn’t think I have thyroid eye disease (she is a specialist in this area), but we continue to monitor.

While the issue isn’t painful exactly, it has made my life very difficult. I feel it when I blink and move my eyeball (so 24/7). It is constant, annoying, and makes me feel like my face is distorted (even though it isn’t). Sometimes it makes me move my right cheek differently and almost makes it exhausted. It is NOT any migraine or sinus issue- and no OTC pain relievers or antibiotics (which I was on earlier this year for another reason) have helped it. 

Any ideas? Could the tear duct be clogged but not visibly irritated? Not to be dramatic and I don’t say this lightly, but it’s caused my mental health to decline

33F I sustained trigeminal nerve damage after a lower bleph. Is there an ophthalmic or facial surgery that could fix it?
I had a lower eyelid blepharoplasty 2 years ago which caused some sort of trigeminal nerve damage on the left side of my face (either direct nerve damage or pressure on the nerve from things being moved around, like fat or my eyelid muscle which tightened quite a bit and looks different). I now have pain in my lower eyelid, jaw, and throat due to the trigeminal reflex (even putting contacts in causes pain in my jaw and throat). I've seen many neurologists who said that because of the nature of my facial pain, the traditional trigeminal neuralgia surgery (an MVD) wouldn't make sense or work, but I'm wondering if they could essentially go back into my lower eyelid like they did in the first surgery to see what's wrong and try to fix the nerve or at least do something to lessen the pain. My lower eyelid is super tight and sits much higher than it used to, and I suspect that contributes to the nerve pain.

Has anyone heard of this kind of surgery (or similar) for atypical facial pain, where the source isn't necessarily your brain but the part of the nerve that's in the face? I'm at a loss.

30F Growth in eye
30F, I've been having recurring eye irritation over the past month that I think is part of a bigger issue. I've been to my eye Dr, it's not an infection or dryness related, and he did confirm there is proptosis. Originally I started noticing some tiny growths/ changes to the inner corner only. My Dr didn't know what to make of it. But now, there is new growth that appears to be starting to move upward/inward onto the actual eye, and a new growth in the outer corner as well under the lid, which was not there before. I will provide pictures. I have swollen parotid and cervical lymph nodes on the same side as the affected eye also that have been there for a few months with no explanation so far. Dr's have been looking into possible lymphoma, but it's taking them way to long. So I'm wondering if this could potentially be lymphoma in my eye now. Also just got out of the hospital with increased intracranial pressure. Worsening headaches, vision, neurological symptoms. So I'm worried whatever this is is spreading at an alarming rate, and since my Dr's don't seem to know, I'm looking for any help to put the pieces together. Thank you.

35F Foreign Body Sensation - Several months
Starting 4 months ago I started to have this FBS in one eye. I went to see a dry eye specialist, was told my eye looked really dry and was given Trvaya (which isn't covered by my insurance). I used it for a month at which the doctor and my regular optometrist said my eyes looked great. I had blepharitis under control and my eye no longer looked dry but I still had this feeling. I do have a few papillae from long term contact use but every doctor has said they aren't a concern and are expected. I also switched my birth control to one that is not an anti-androgen. I limit contact use to when I need them (a few times a month at most) and only dailies

It continued to have some mild moments so I saw a cornea specialist just to make sure that I am not scratching it, etc. (I had also planned on having refractive surgery so this is quite disheartening)- they put me on a prescription antihistamine and steroid. These things made the situation worse, so they pulled me off the steroid (though I feel I wasn't necessarily being heard in this apt).

I was then told to move to pataday instead. This dried out my eyes, so I couldn't tell if it was helping or not.

I went on to see several more ophthalmologists and optometrists, all who actually said I do not have allergies, so there's no need for the anti-histamine and to keep my routine basic.

My routine  
\-omega 3s  
\-vitamin d + b12  
\-recently started Blink's tear supplement

\-scrub with tea tree oil  
\-cleanse with occusoft demodex  
\-warm compress + massage  
\-eye drop and then mask for bed  
\-OTC drops (maybe i need to use these more consistently)

The doctors are now saying my eye looks pretty good actually, just very mild dry eye that can be treated with OTC but this feeling hasn't gone away. One doctor plucked eyelashes just in case they were touching my eye.

I am considering adding Omega 7 into the mix.

I'm open to suggestions and also if anyone's experienced anything similar? Please let me know if any details will help.There are moments where it's fine but it's consistently there, sometimes I'd say a .5, other times its 2-3.

26F Need help with severe dryness upon waking up
Please suggest best night time eye ointment

I have dry eyes for few months. I also sleep with my eyes slightly open which further dries them out. I am having recurrent corneal erosion in right eye. So in that eye I am using Moxifloxacin antibiotic ointment. In the left eye I am using Aquim gel eye ointment (0.18 % Hyaluronic acid). I am okay during the day but my eyes feel really dry and uncomfortable upon waking up. I have to put systane drops as soon as i wake up to feel better. What is the best Night time ointment to prevent dryness and erosions. Kindly recommend.

28F why can I move my eyess outward on command? See video.
Is this normal? I'd love to learn the reason behind this! 

I've been able to do this for a long time but it's gotten easier lately. I always called it unfocusing and I actually thought my eyes crossed when I did it. Apparently, they both move outward. Should I be concerned? Sometimes it happens on its own and it feels comfortable. I have no other eye problems that I can think of. 

You can see them snap back in when I refocus. Things don't really go blurry as much as I just see double. Really weird!

Subconjunctival hemorrhage - now what appears to be a small opening?


Hello folks!

This is my eye after 16 hours of puking due to gluten poisoning. Celiac life is no fun!

I got it checked out yesterday by my optometrist, very shortly after I noticed. She checked the pressure and blood vessels and all were normal/healthy. She gave me some drops to lubricate my eye.

Today I had some slight discomfort but it went away quickly. I got home from work and took those pictures and noticed what looks like a small, round opening or hole in the outer most layer of my eye?

Is this normal or is there anything to be aware of?

Yesterday there was a sort of blood bubble type spot in the blood. I am wondering if this is now the open area? 

Thank you all so much :)

60F. Distorted vision nml retinal exam
l'm myopic (-9.5 ) contact lens wearer. 
l've also been diagnosed with Sjogren's.
I've noticed that my vision in one eye is distorted for few months.
The words in my center vision are slightly higher than the rest. In fact, anything horizontal is higher in the middle. Like a pitcher's mound. I went to a retina specialist had OCT and retina looks good and has a similar thickness to previous exams. My Dr. suggested I see a cornea person bc maybe any Sjogren's related dryness or decades of lens wear has given me an irregular shaped cornea. That's all ok w me. My only concern was amd, which it's not, and any brain origin. Do you think I should see a neuroophthamologist as well? Thanks!

Eye symmetry tanked my confidence 



My eye has always been like this for as long as I can remember, everybody says it’s fine and it’s not. I cant record myself or FaceTime people without hiding my eye. I remember even complaining to my mom about it only for the doctor to say it’s fine but this cannot be normal. I cant point out what exactly is wrong but something has always been wrong it’s never anybody I can relate to physically when taking a picture. Idk what to do, it affects my life because my dream occupation requires me to show my face and I cant physically bring myself to do that even fully groomed it can only help so much with my self esteem.
 if its ptosis or really bad face symmetry smh.

I've had floaters for a while that were in the corner of my eye and I never really noticed them except in bright lighting. Now they move more fluidly and across more of my visual field (from one side to the other) when they used to be a bit more rigid. I've been to the optometrist 8 months ago and OCT scan came back normal.

Does anyone know what causes this or if it's of concern? Very anxious about it
I am nearsighted

18F Red eyes throughout the month


Hello everyone. I don't understand what's wrong with my eyes. They've been so red for a month. I understand, I've been using artificial tears for a year and a half. Last year I didn't wear contact lenses at all on the recommendation of an ophthalmologist. Then I started wearing them very rarely in the summer. About 3-4 times a month. Then at the beginning of September I went to the gym. During this month I've worn contact lenses 3 times. I saw an ophthalmologist 2 weeks ago. He said that I'm healthy and that there are no pathologies. I also asked him about anti-inflammatory drops; he laughed and said that I didn’t need them. He said that I can safely wear contact lenses. But the redness doesn't go away. I notice new vessels appearing and they don't disappear later. I don't think this is normal. I'm also worried that these vessels go straight to the iris of the eye. Maybe someone has already encountered this, please help. I doubt that the problem is in dry eye. I immediately put drops in my eye if I feel that it is necessary. In any case, how can I get rid of these vessels?

45f, eyelid twitch for two months
I have only ever had this happen before for a day or so at a time, but my left eyelid has now been twitching for about two months. It stops sometimes but it's been every day, sometimes most of the day and even when I'm drifting off to sleep. Caffeine intake has not increased- I have two shots in the morning. Sleep has not decreased. I could always use more sleep but I don't think I'm majorly sleep deprived. I get probably between 6.5-7 hours a night on weekdays and more on weekends. I haven't been under extra stress that I'm aware of. I am on 400 mg of Gabapentin since last winter. Also, don't know if this is relevent, but I've had issues with this particular eye way more than the other (cysts, floater, a bit more dryness than the right eye). I do have an appointment with opthalmology but not for another 5 weeks and over the phone. This is really driving me crazy!

27M wavy lines but OCT scan does not see problem
Wavy Lines, eye scans come back fine

Hello, I am looking for some help with some visual symptoms I have had. Recently, I have noticed some slight bent/wavy lines while working in excel and on my phone. An amsler grid confirms this distortion, but mostly if I blink in my left eye.

A few years ago, I was diagnosed with Posterior Vitreous Detachment, as I had been seeing flashing lights and floaters. I had continuous check ups for about a year, as I continued seeing flashes. I still the occasional flash today, but the frequency is much better.

On my last exam regarding the PVD a few years ago, the opthalmologist mentioned I had some "macular drusen," and mentioned that as my grandfather had AMD, I would most likely get it as I age as well.

With the recent visual changes for few days, I scheduled an appointment with my eye doctor, who gave me a dilated pupil examination, and performed and OCT scan. They said everything is fine, and sent me in my way. I have had an OCT with each annual eye exam since my PVD, and all other doctors have said the same.

Is this a condition I should monitor/seek a second opinion? Or should I continue to stick to my regular eye exams (barring any changes in vision), and they not to worry about it?

Thanks for any help you all can provide!

22M Can ocular migraines be constant?
I have been suffering from a flashing/flickering spot on the right corner of my eye since around 2-3 months (see video). This only happens when I'm lookin at bright surfaces such as white walls as seen in the video. I've been to 2 different ophthalmologists about this and they couldn't find anything after dillated exam and OCT. One of them said this could be ocular migraine even the this is happening every time I look at a bright surface. 

I had ocular migraines before which lasted around 25-30 minutes but this has been going nonstop for 3 months. So do you guys think this could be ocular migraine that is constant or is it something about my eyes? Thank you.

27F blepharitis or viral conjunctivitis
ETA info - I'm a white female, don't smoke or do drugs, drink socially less than once a month

Two and a half weeks ago I started feeling like my eyelashes were turning in towards my eyes and that my eye was very irritated, and my lids seemed to have eczema on them, very flaky and tight (not itchy), for a few days I used eye drops for dry eyes to try and see if it would resolve and it didn't. It actually got worse, with redness, swelling but no itching.

3 days later I went to the pharmacist as it was a Sunday and she said blepharitis, to use blephaclean wipes and put vaseline on my eyelids, so I bought a fresh tub of vaseline and the wipes.

The next day I contacted my GP who confirmed that it looked like blepharitis (via a photo, not an in person appt) and told me categorically no more vaseline on my lids, that it could clog the glands. They also prescribed me a chloramphenicol ointment and told me to keep using the blephaclean wipes, so I did, with ointment applied 4X a day.

2 weeks after the whole issue started I re-contacted my GP who sent me to Specsavers for an eye check (I realise now I should have done this sooner). They checked my eyes and said viral conjunctivitis, on the way out now after 2 weeks but probably being irritated by the blephaclean wipes and only helped mildly by the ointment as it's oily and was providing lubrication to my very sad eyelids. 

The optometrist told me he could see 1 single blocked meiobian (sp?) gland of about 60 and he didn't think it was blepharitis at all, to stop the wipes and ointment and switch to just using lubricating eye drops to help. 

This has given me some relief, I don't have the swelling and most of the redness has gone down but my question is, my eyelids have gone flakey and horrible more than ever now. The eye drops go in my eye so I've been left with no treatment for the lids, is this correct? 

I was told to give it a few days and the virus should resolve itself fully but today is day 4 and my lids are still so flakey! I'm guessing I need to go back to Specsavers but is there something I'm missing here? Should I be doing anything to push my lids to heal or is this likely to be another incorrect diagnosis? Can viral conjunctivitis trigger blepharitis or vice versa? I am lost here and it's been 2.5 weeks of my eyelids feeling wrong, and being aware of my eyelids for this long has made me desperate for the days when I didn't feel them at all! 

Sorry for such a long post - I've tried to include all relevant information but realise I've probably left some out so please ask for clarification if there's anything missing. I would appreciate any help, though I understand it's limited through a text post!

I have had a watery eye for almost 2 years. I had DCR surgery and unfortunately it did not work. I waiting for a date for a revision surgery. I asked my doctor how is a revision surgery different from the original surgery. Ie what will you do differently this time to ensure a success? Unfortunately my doctor was quite condescending and dismissive and said ‘plenty of things’. I get it, I am not a doctor but I just want to know the success rate is going to be better than the original. I need this to work so the suffering can stop. 

So my question for anyone is 1. Have you had a revision DCR surgery and did it work for you second time round or not? 
For any doctors, 2 . What is the success rate of revision DCRs? 3 What exactly do you differently in revision DCRs? Give me the science speak. 

My doctor said the 1st failed because I heal too well so the scar tissue healed and blocked the path. Ok and what will you do to stop that? I am so frustrated.

21F: Sharp pain in corner of left eye

I use daily eye drops (Systane original) for dry eyes every morning and I’ve been doing fine ever since I started using them. I’m on Dupixent which is known to cause blepharoconjunctivitis but I haven’t had a case of that in 3 years. 

I’m having a sharp pain (feels like a cut) in the corner of my left eye. It mildly hurts every time I blink. When I took pictures it looked red and inflamed. 

Yesterday my eyes were really itchy and I rubbed them kind of roughly, could that maybe be the cause?

29 M Uneven Pupils
I  noticed that my right pupil is slightly bigger than my left few weeks ago. At first I thought it was caused after starting Zoloft but after seeing a photo I took a week before I started taking it, I realized it was already like that.

There’s no other symptoms. No headaches, blurry vision, dizziness, etc. I do wear glasses and have very dry eyes and am still recovering from an intense 2 months of anxiety. 

Both eyes react to light and dark. If I cover one eye the other dilates quickly and so on. I’ve talked to my doctor and she did some minor light test and wasn’t too concerned since both my eyes react to light just fine. In sunny light, they’re the same size. In dim light the right one is slightly bigger than the left. If I shine light to my eyes, they get smaller but the right one still stays very slightly bigger than the left. 

I have an appointment with an Opthalmologist but that’s not until December and I already had an appointment with an optometrist and was told my prescription had changed very slightly but there was no discussion of the uneven pupils. 

Is this something I should be worried about? I have bad health anxiety so the moment I realized I already had this before the Zoloft I had a panic attack and my anxiety is through the roof again.

25M Pupils react differently to light
I have anisocoria, which I noticed around 6 years ago. I understand this is normal in ~10% of people, so that's not what worries me. The issue is the pupils react differently to light. I want to figure out if this is worth worrying about before I get a specialist appointment.

I see info about a test where you shine a light in each eye. However the images show a person with typical eyes in normal conditions, so I don't understand the meaning for myself who has anisocoria. So I made an image which shows my pupil size in dim lighting conditions, and with the flashlight pointing at the left and right eyes. If it is relevant which eye is right or left, I drew it the way I see it the mirror.



I also notice the bigger-pupil eye gets sore after looking at screens faster than the left.

26M Got my first pair of glasses back for the 2nd time and am still seeing double vision wondering what to do from here
So I got my first pair of glasses about a month an half ago because I had my first eye checkup in years. During that first visit they diagnosed my eyesight to be about 20/50 that I needed glasses. I got my prescription ordered my glasses and got them about two weeks later, that prescription was awful, I had significant double vision (anything bright was stacked on top of each other) and when I would look down the ground looked crooked, like I was standing on a very steep hill. The glasses also gave me horrible migraines and I couldn't get used to them after a weekend of trying, the did a reevaluation without dilatation and my unassisted vision was 20/30 and with my bad prescription it was 20/25, the new prescription is a lot better and usable but I can't wear them after dark because the road signs are not readable due to being doubled up on each other. When I say doubled up I mean there is ghost both above and below the illuminated object about about 20% to 50% opacity along with the actual object that is 100% opacity, so like a green stoplight will look like an up and down green smear and a speed limit sign will be an up and down white smear but I can still make out the numbers on top but can't read any of the smaller text because it's obscured by the ghosting. I do not get this with my normal vision, the only visual oddity I have driving at night as sometimes the yellow line will have a second yellow line above it. I think they said my Diagnosis was an astigmatism and nearsightedness, they don't do after visit summaries though so I don't know for sure as that was back in August.

I do not have the prescription numbers as they only give those if you get your glasses somewhere else and I bought mine there, I just don't know what to do now it takes over a month to get an appointment there and another two weeks to get my glasses. They did do the reevaluation for free as well as replaced the lenses for free but waiting a month and a half between every new prescription is very inconvenient. I am also not sure what I need to ask them about to get the right evaluation done, during my initial visit they only did the letter tests, nothing else was done vision-wise but they did look at my retinas and measure my IPD but I also do not have that number.

Where do I go from here? Would I even be able to get a refund this late, my initial appointment was at the end of august, as I am not too thrilled with them but there really aren't a lot of other options around here without traveling further out and my insurance had already paid out the 1 set of glasses per year. Again I am really sorry I don't have prescription numbers but they said I do not need them even though I asked several times, they said they could mail them but it would take a few weeks to get them as they have to get authorization from their head office. Thanks for any help, I am new to wearing glasses and am now sure how all this works. I may just be overreacting and everyone deals with the double vision thing and it's something I'll just have to get used to.

27F Iris “leaking” into pupil. What is this?
*I have ADHD, I take vyvanse. I smoke half a pack a day. Recently diagnosed with binocular vision dysfunction after asking to be tested for it and was recommended neurolense glasses. I currently don’t wear glasses as my last pair didn’t help my symptoms*

What is this called? Pictures attached from the eye doctor and a picture I took at home. I had an eye test two years ago and the doctor showed me this picture but didn't seem too concerned. I saw another eye doctor yesterday and he said the last doctor got my prescription wrong - they said I was a negative but I am actually a positive. He saw the same thing in my eye and I'm not sure if it was related but he said he thinks I may have had uveitis in the past so we are monitoring that. I would like to know what this is. There was too much going on and too much information for me to remember everything that was said.

36M Eyes not "working together" seemingly
36m Caucasian   
  
Hi all, firstly i read the sticky, and have tried warm compress and artificial tears, both make my eyes feel slightly better for a moment but not super lasting.

  
recently, for lack of better description, I've felt like my eyes have not been working correctly together to sync up one image. It's visually apparent that my eyes are seemingly try to take their two separate image and make them one, but i am at moments having what feels like a light double vision; my vision physically feels very push-pull-y, is the best way i can describe it. It also feels/has felt for awhile that my right eye is "further back in my skull/pulled back" which i know physically it isn't, its just the sensation.  
 This has been going on for almost 2 months (the right eye feeling further back sensation has been going on for over 1.5 years, and the doctor doesn't seem to think its any problem, but figured id list it)  
  
 Ive gone to my optometrist and he was pretty flippant and dismissive about my claim so im looking for hopefully some insight and guidance.

* A few important facts 
   * i have astigmatism (maybe this is a root cause?)
   * this has been going on for a little over a month and a half or so, at least as far as i can tell
      * I have been under stress in my personal life consistently during this time frame as well
   * I wear glasses and contacts, this sensation is present with or without (seemingly less with contacts)
   * the sensation seems less intense at night
   * my right eye is my "worse" eye - it also seems to have image renention/bright light burn in more frequently/longer 
      * literally had a weird burn in moment the other day where closing my eye lid it was a bright white blob i could see with yellow/red haloing (like a bright light in darkness) and it took about 4-5 mins to fully disappate and even then there was translucent ghosting ofit
   * Unsure if this apparent burn in that is more frequent in my right eye may be contributing to this feeling of "double vision"
      * as in could the translucent ghosting/haloing of light or images sticking around be making my eye sight feel like its doubled from my eyes trying to compensate for it?
   * the caffeine intake in my diet is admittedly higher than it should be(trying to cut back)
   * I take buproprion 150mg (just went down from 300 this past week) and finesteride (1mg)  as far as prescription drugs
   * vitmains: l theanine, b12, zinc, ashwagandha, magnesium, fishoil, ginko biloba
   * Fairly active 2-3 times a week at the gym 
   * I drink alcohol and smoke marijuana occasionally, but not frequently; few times a month at best

Thanks in advance!

19M Can one's eye whites have a yellow tint even if they're completely healthy and don't have anything wrong going on medically?
I've had blood tests done and other things regarding it, so this isn't really a medical advice question, I already know all about that. I'm just curious about why my eye whites have a slight yellow tint around the edges and I can't ask it on the other eye sub. I dont smoke or drink, my blood tests are always fine, I'm healthy...yet for so many years now, the corners and edges of my eyes have always had this yellowish tint (not super yellow, more like a watered out yellow, like a stain) is it genetic? Is it just how I am? I haven't really gotten any answer for it besides stuff like "there's nothing wrong going on"

Again not looking for medical advice, I've already gone through the whole process of checking if there's problems and everything seems fine, I just...wanna know why they are like this if nothing seems to be wrong at all

32F strange vision issues - overexposed upon waking, staticky in the dark
I've been having a couple of odd vision issues over the past few months and am not sure if they could potentially be related to my eyes or if they sound more like a neuro/psychological/hormonal problem. For background, I have PTSD and generalized anxiety. I changed my meds 5 months ago and these issues started probably a month or two ago. I also had a baby 18 months ago and a miscarriage 3 months ago. I'm a mess, I know. I'm just not sure if this could be an actual vision issue so figured I would post in here and see what you all have to say. As far as my eye health, my last eye appointment was a little over a year ago (I am overdue and need to make an appointment, I will ask about this there too of course) and my optos imaging looked normal. I have astigmatism in both eyes, but my vision itself is pretty good. I do wear glasses with a light prescription. So here's the issue I've been having:

Upon waking, sometimes my vision seems to be overexposed/lacking contrast. I often notice it in the shower - my bathroom is entirely white so I imagine that doesn't help the issue. It does also happen not in the shower, though. It tends to resolve itself within a few minutes, but it sends my anxiety soaring so I tend to look for it/worry about it returning/hyperfocus on my vision. At this point, it kind of feels like a chicken or egg situation - which came first, the anxiety or the vision oddity? The other issue that goes along with this is my night vision. It's awful. I can barely see in the dark, and my night vision is pretty staticky. Kind of feels like a camera/film with a low ISO.

So my question: does this sound like it could be an actual issue with my eye/eyes? Or does this sound like maybe it's more hormonal, or my anxiety is just being a bitch as usual? Any insight would be appreciated!

20F retina issues?
 Did the amsler grid for fun and I have wavy lines in one spot the the left corner of my vision yesterday. I have astmagtism and I'm already a glaucoma suspect. Should I make an appointment to my doctor immediately? 

I'm going back for a check up in December but I honestly don't know if I should wait that long.

22F, dry eye or optic neuritis?
Just got out of urgent care. My left eye has been hurting a lot since yesterday. Literally so bad I wanted to rip it out.

Feels like there's a boulder in my eyesocket, I have a blurry spot in the middle of my vision, completely blurry when looking left. When looking left the eye burns like a b and the pain is worse when moving the eye. The pain is like there's immense pressure inside the eyeball.

Eye pressure was normal, pupils respond normally but my left eye is very sensitive to light. No redness or watering. It doesn't feel like I have something in there nor have I had any injury to it. 

I had a sinus infection last week and thought it was related to that but my sinuses are clear and no sign of inflammation.

I got some hydrating eye drops but I felt a bit suspicious so I googled it ofc and none of the symptoms match to dry eyes. What came up was optic neuritis and from what I read it matches almost perfectly.

Could the doctor have missed it or is it just that one of my eyes is so dry suddenly that I feel like I'm dying from the pain?

29M Scotoma due to Valsalva Retinopathy, looking for some hope/support/experiences Retina
Hi all, four days ago while diving on vacation in Indonesia I (29yo male, no medical history) suddenly noticed a black spot right in the middle of my vision in my left eye. I was able to see an ophthalmologist the day after, who referred me to a retina specialist whom I saw yet again the day after. This specialist told me (and showed me the fundoscopy picture) that I have a small subhyaloid bleeding, right in the middle of my macula but covering perhaps about only a fifth of it. The spot went from black the first day, to blurry the second day onwards, and when I look at a light source it looks orange-brownish. Doctor estimated it will go away in about three weeks, but I'm seeing stories of people still having blurry vision after a year, and seeing as it's impairing my reading a lot I'm still very worried. I know there are people here with much worse, but I'm looking for some hope. Does anyone here have direct or indirect experience with something similar?

40 yo male ,  had laser photo coagulation done Sunday , should I be worried.
Noticed some weird floaters Saturday doing yard work.   Had my eye dr luckily meet me Sunday in office ,  everything looked good on scans etc until he found a small hole .   He proceeded to do photocoagulation.  83 laser blasters later I went home around 3pm Sunday.   Vision seems to be better ,  he said floater was due to the gel giving way in my eye (I’m 40) .   However 2 days ago, while driving at night  since sometimes get a halo effect and also will get small floaters (almost look like super small cells) only can be seen if I squint in low light and concentrate .  But it’s not a ton , I see the dr in two weeks .   I know healing takes 7-10 days , am I being paranoid ?    I had some small flashes the day of and yesterday where the laser hit my retina ,  no longer happens today .  Again vision seems stable / improved but I notice more floaters (I think) it could just be me being paranoid.   I cannot see floaters under normal conditions I have to squint and look for them.   Also forgot I have small amounts of pigmentary glaucoma.

26F need help with Recurrent corneal erosion
I am facing issues with corneal abrasion and recurrent corneal erosions since few months. My eyes remain partially open when I sleep.

This is the timeline of my case:


*April 2022:*
I got lasik surgery in *2022*. Since then I have dry eyes problem on and off.


*June 2024* :
My right eye became very red and vision became blurry. Doctor said i have a corneal abrasion in my right eye. I don't know how that abrasion happened because I didn't get an injury in my eye.
Doctor treated it with *Systane ultra drops* and *Aquim gel lubricating eye ointment* at night.


After few weeks I started getting recurrent corneal erosions. I would get extreme pain and discomfort in my right eye upon waking up and opening my eye.
Doctor treated it with *systane ultra*, *FML steroid drops* and *Hypertonic saline drops*. 
There was no pain till the steroid and saline drops were going on.
My eyes remain partially open when I sleep. Doctor suggested taping my eyelids at night. I did that also.


But I again started getting the erosions. 
Doctor has placed a *BCL* in my eye and given me *Mahaflox antibiotic* ointment at night. I am using *Systane complete* eye drops.
Doctor said he will take the lens out after a few weeks.


Its been 4 months but this problem isn't getting fully resolved. Kindly share any suggestions. Should I sleep with an eye mask. Will that help keep my eyes fully closed. I am worried what if my eyes open under the mask and the mask rubs against the cornea.
